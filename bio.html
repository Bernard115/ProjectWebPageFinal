                <h1>My Background</h1>
                <p class="mt-4">
                  I was born on May 21st, 2002 in Vlore, Albania. I came to Canada at the age of 11 and moved to Toronto at 15. Despite the major climate differences, I easily grew acustomed to Canada and am thankful for the opportunities that Canada has given me. From a small age I have noticed Toronto grow more reliant on information technology with smartphones becoming a multipurpose device for day to day living and WiFI networks being available every street you walk through. I would say that this city has not only affected my standards of living, but has also influnced my interests in post-secondary education.

            <h2 class="display-4">Goals and Hobbies</h2>
            <p class="lead">I am invested in learning new software that are heavily used in my profession. My goals as an individual are more than just graduating and getting a job. I plan to become a professional in my line of work; someone who others can depend on, and call when requiring my services. I want to leave a mark on the world by doing what I love most and maybe even inspire others along the way.<br><br>
            Other than my passions, I also have hobbies that I like to indulge in when I have the time. I enjoy working out at the gym and make sure to go at least 5 times a day. I believe that we owe it to ourselves to have a healthy mind and body. I also enjoy playing sports like soccer and volleyball even though I rarely have the time or oppertunity to play sports. I enjoy watching sports like boxing, mma and like playing video games, specifically fighting games like Mortal Kombat and Tekken.  </p>
